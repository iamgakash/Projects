# AdventureWorks
A Microsoft Power BI business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.

The dataset was supplied with the [Maven Analytics Power BI Desktop course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). This data was derived from the [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) available from Microsoft.

The customer base is spread across 6 countries on 3 continents: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States. Sales and return data is available for the period between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022. Customer profiles include date of birth, annual income, education level, number of children, occupation and homeowner status.
