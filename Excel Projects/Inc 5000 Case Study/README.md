## Data Preparation:

 - Upon review of the dataset, it was noted that there exists a null value along with several occurrences of zero values within the 'workers' attribute. It is imperative to ensure data integrity and coherence, particularly given the significance of this attribute. Hence, these null and zero values have been replaced with corresponding data sourced from ZoomInfo. This enhancement aligns more closely with the dataset's temporal context, specifically referring to the year 2019.
- Furthermore, a zero value was identified within the 'founded' attribute. Such anomalies can significantly impact the reliability of analyses and interpretations. Therefore, to maintain consistency and accuracy, the zero value has been replaced with the appropriate founding year.
- Additionally, to streamline the dataset and optimize its relevance, extraneous fields such as 'profile', 'url', and 'metro' have been removed. This action aims to focus the dataset on its core attributes, enhancing its usability and facilitating more efficient analyses.
- The revenue column was refined by converting textual expressions like ""million"" and ""billion"" into corresponding numerical values.
